---

## 🗑️ Files That Should Be Deleted

### 1. **Critical: Nested Directory** - `Python-fastapi-multiauth-uv/`

**Location:** `/home/mj/mjcode/Python-fastapi-multiauth-uv/Python-fastapi-multiauth-uv/`

**Issue:** Duplicate nested directory containing old FIX.md (57KB)

**Why delete:**
- This is leftover from a previous session
- Contains obsolete FIX.md that's no longer needed
- All fixes from FIX.md have been applied (see FIXES_APPLIED.md)
- Creates confusion with nested project structure

**Action:** `rm -rf Python-fastapi-multiauth-uv/`

---

### 2. **Duplicate Scripts** - Multiple check-deps versions

**Files:**
- ✅ **KEEP:** `scripts/check-deps-working.py` (165 lines) - This is the working version
- ❌ **DELETE:** `scripts/check-deps.py` (194 lines) - Uses httpx (external dep)
- ❌ **DELETE:** `scripts/check-deps-simple.py` (146 lines) - Has parsing bugs

**Why delete:**
- You have 3 scripts that do the same thing
- `check-deps-working.py` is the only one that works correctly
- Others are iterations/experiments that failed
- Creates confusion about which one to use

**Actions:**
```bash
rm scripts/check-deps.py
rm scripts/check-deps-simple.py
mv scripts/check-deps-working.py scripts/check-deps.py  # Rename to canonical name
```

---

### 3. **Generated Test Coverage** - `htmlcov/`

**Location:** `/home/mj/mjcode/Python-fastapi-multiauth-uv/htmlcov/`

**Issue:** Generated HTML coverage reports (3.5MB, 100+ files)

**Why delete:**
- Already in .gitignore (shouldn't be tracked)
- Gets regenerated every time you run `pytest --cov`
- Takes up unnecessary disk space
- Not needed in repository

**Action:** `rm -rf htmlcov/`

**Note:** This directory is properly ignored in .gitignore, but still exists on disk

---

### 4. **Generated Pytest Cache** - `.pytest_cache/`

**Location:** `/home/mj/mjcode/Python-fastapi-multiauth-uv/.pytest_cache/`

**Issue:** Pytest cache directory

**Why delete:**
- Already in .gitignore
- Gets regenerated automatically
- No value in keeping it

**Action:** `rm -rf .pytest_cache/`
