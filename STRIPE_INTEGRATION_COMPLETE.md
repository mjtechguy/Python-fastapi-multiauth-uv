SELECT sp.name, COUNT(*) as subscribers, SUM(sp.price_monthly) as mrr
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN subscription_plans sp ON s.plan_id = sp.id
WHERE s.status = 'active'
GROUP BY sp.name;

-- Failed payments last 30 days
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices
WHERE status = 'open'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Pre-Launch Checklist

**Stripe Configuration:**
- [ ] Switch to live mode in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Update `.env` with live keys (`sk_live_`, `pk_live_`)
- [ ] Create live products and prices
- [ ] Update price IDs in environment variables
- [ ] Configure production webhook endpoint
- [ ] Enable Stripe Tax (if selling globally)
- [ ] Set up Radar rules for fraud prevention

**Application:**
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Seed subscription plans
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint publicly accessible
- [ ] Configure email service for receipts
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Review terms of service
- [ ] Test with $1 real transaction

**Compliance:**
- [ ] Review PCI compliance requirements
- [ ] Ensure SCA/PSD2 compliance (if EU)
- [ ] Privacy policy includes billing
- [ ] Refund policy documented

### Launch Steps

1. **Deploy application** with live Stripe keys
2. **Configure webhook** in Stripe Dashboard
3. **Test with real $1 payment** using real card
4. **Monitor first 10 transactions** closely
5. **Set up alerts** for payment failures

---

## 💡 Next Steps

### Enhance Email Notifications
Currently, email notification tasks are structured but not fully implemented. To complete:

1. Use existing email service in `app/tasks/email.py`
2. Create billing email templates
3. Implement in `app/tasks/billing.py`:
   - Receipt emails
   - Trial ending reminders
   - Payment failure notifications
   - Subscription change confirmations

### Add Usage-Based Billing
For metered billing (e.g., API calls over quota):

1. Enable in Stripe Dashboard
2. Create metered price IDs
3. Implement `report_usage_to_stripe` task
4. Schedule periodic reporting

### Implement CLI Commands
Add billing commands to `cli.py`:
```python
@app.command()
def billing():
    """Billing and subscription management."""
    pass

@billing.command()
def plans():
    """List subscription plans."""
    # Implementation
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhooks not working

**Check:**
1. Webhook URL is publicly accessible
2. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches dashboard
3. Application logs for signature errors
4. Use `stripe listen` for local testing

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test locally
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/v1/webhooks/stripe

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f api | grep webhook
```

### Issue: Quotas not updating

**Check:**
1. Webhook events processing successfully
2. `plan_id` in subscription metadata
3. `billing_events` table for errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Manually sync
python -c "
from app.tasks.billing import update_organization_quotas
update_organization_quotas.delay('org-id-here')
"
```

### Issue: Tests failing

**Check:**
1. Database migrations applied
2. Test database seeded with plans
3. Stripe test keys in test environment

**Fix:**
```bash
# Reset test database
uv run python -m alembic downgrade base
uv run python -m alembic upgrade head
uv run python scripts/seed_subscription_plans.py
```
