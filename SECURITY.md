## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-security-email]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Multiple authentication strategies (local, OAuth2, Keycloak)
- Password strength validation
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Data Protection
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Secure token generation
- API key authentication
- Database connection encryption

### API Security
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
- Input validation with Pydantic
- SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM

### Monitoring & Auditing
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Session management
- IP address logging

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment
1. Use strong `SECRET_KEY` (minimum 32 characters)
2. Enable HTTPS/TLS in production
3. Set `APP_ENV=production`
4. Configure proper CORS origins
5. Use environment variables for secrets
6. Enable rate limiting
7. Regular security updates
8. Database backups
9. Monitor audit logs
10. Implement network segmentation

### For Development
1. Never commit secrets to version control
2. Use `.env.example` for documentation only
3. Run security scans regularly
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Follow principle of least privilege
6. Review code for security issues
7. Use type checking and linting

## Dependency Security

We use:
- `safety` for known vulnerability scanning
- `bandit` for code security analysis
- Automated CI/CD security checks
- Regular dependency updates

Run security checks:
```bash
make security
```

## Compliance

This framework is designed to support:
- GDPR compliance (data protection)
- SOC 2 requirements (audit logging)
- HIPAA considerations (data encryption)
- PCI DSS guidelines (secure authentication)

## Security Updates

Security patches will be released as soon as possible after verification. Subscribe to releases for notifications.
